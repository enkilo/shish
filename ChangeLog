   * there have been no ChangeLog entries for a long time
     while development was in progress. I don't think detailed
     ChangeLog entries are already required at this time, because 
     shish is under heavy development by just one person. However
     I will write ChangeLog entries about major achievments and
     design changes/improvements.

   * the development is currently suspended due to the need of
     a libsgui release (http://www.blah.ch/libsgui/)
     shish development will be resumed in a month or so.
