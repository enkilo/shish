What is implemented and needs to be tested:

- except for shell functions, the whole parser grammar
  is established
- command and variable expansion
- variables
- evaluation of conditionals and loops
- evaluation of PS1 for custom prompts
- some (non-standard) builtins

What is implemented and is buggy:

- redirections seem to work most of the time, but the fdtable
  resolving code (which "lazy-resolves" redirections) can end
  up in an infinite recursion
- simple line editing (to be rewritten with a finer terminal abstraction
  and key-bindings)  
- a basic command history, which is not properly saved currently

What needs to be implemented:

- implement background processes and more sophisticated job control
- fix iofd_exec() ???
- glob check on subargs other than argstr
- tilde expansion
- shell functions
- stripped here documents (<<-)
- key bindings
- terminal abstraction (for special capabilities etc.)
- closing of file descriptors on >&-
- conform to 3.9.1.1 "Command Search and Execution"
- push variable stack only when needed?
- exporting of unset variables
- leaving interactive mode i.E. in a forked subshell should free the prompt tree
