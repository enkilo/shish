 4.5  cd - Change working directory


 4.5.1  Synopsis


 cd  [directory]


 4.5.2  Description

 The cd utility shall change the working directory of the current shell
 execution environment; see 3.12.

 When invoked with no operands, and the HOME environment variable is set
 to a nonempty value, the directory named in the HOME environment variable
 shall become the new working directory.  If HOME is empty or is
 undefined, the default behavior is implementation defined.


 4.5.3  Options

 None.


 4.5.4  Operands

 The following operands shall be supported by the implementation:

    directory   An absolute or relative pathname of the directory that
                becomes the new working directory.  The interpretation of
                a relative pathname by cd depends on the CDPATH
                environment variable.  If directory is -, the results are
                implementation defined.


 4.5.5  External Influences

 4.5.5.1  Standard Input

 None.


 4.5.5.2  Input Files

 None.

 4.5.5.3  Environment Variables

 The following environment variables shall affect the execution of cd:

    CDPATH             A colon-separated list of pathnames that refer to
                       directories.  If the directory operand does not
                       begin with a slash (/) character, and the first
                       component is not dot or dot-dot, cd shall search
                       for directory relative to each directory named in
                       the CDPATH variable, in the order listed.  The new
                       working directory shall be set to the first
                       matching directory found.  An empty string in place
                       of a directory pathname represents the current
                       directory.  If CDPATH is not set, it shall be
                       treated as if it were an empty string.

    HOME               The name of the home directory, used when no
                       directory operand is specified.

    LANG               This variable shall determine the locale to use for
                       the locale categories when both LC_ALL and the
                       corresponding environment variable (beginning with
                       LC_) do not specify a locale.  See 2.6.

    LC_ALL             This variable shall determine the locale to be used
                       to override any values for locale categories
                       specified by the settings of LANG or any
                       environment variables beginning with LC_.

    LC_CTYPE           This variable shall determine the locale for the
                       interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data
                       as characters (e.g., single- versus multibyte
                       characters in arguments).

    LC_MESSAGES        This variable shall determine the language in which
                       messages should be written.


 4.5.5.4  Asynchronous Events

 Default.

 P1003.2/D11.2                               INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY--POSIX

 4.5.6.1  Standard Output

 If a nonempty directory name from CDPATH is used, an absolute pathname of
 the new working directory shall be written to the standard output as
 follows:

       "%s\n", <new directory>

 Otherwise, there shall be no output.


 4.5.6.2  Standard Error

 Used only for diagnostic messages.

 4.5.6.3  Output Files

 None.


 4.5.7  Extended Description

 None.


 4.5.8  Exit Status

 The cd utility shall exit with one of the following values:

     0    The directory was successfully changed.

    >0    An error occurred.


 4.5.9  Consequences of Errors

 The working directory remains unchanged.

 390                                     4 Execution Environment Utilities





 Part 2: SHELL AND UTILITIES                                 P1003.2/D11.2

 Since cd affects the current shell execution environment, it is generally
 provided as a shell regular built-in.  If it is called in a subshell or    1
 separate utility execution environment, such as one of the following:      1

       (cd /tmp)                                                            1
       nohup cd                                                             1
       find . -exec cd {} \;                                                1

 it will not affect the working directory of the caller's environment.      1

 The use of the CDPATH was introduced in the System V shell.  Its use is
 analogous to the use of the PATH variable in the shell.  Earlier systems
 such as the BSD C-shell used a shell parameter cdpath for this purpose.

 History_of_Decisions_Made

 A common extension when HOME is undefined is to get the login directory
 from the user database for the invoking user.  This does not occur on
 System V implementations.

 Not included in this description are the features from the KornShell such
 as setting OLDPWD, toggling current and previous directory (cd -), and
 the two-operand form of cd (cd old new). This standard does not specify
 the results of cd - or of calls with more than one operand.  Since these
 extensions are mostly used in interactive situations, they may be
 considered for inclusion in POSIX.2a.  The result of cd - and of using no
 arguments with HOME unset or null have been made implementation defined
 at the request of the POSIX.6 security working group.

 The setting of the PWD variable was removed from earlier drafts, as it
 can be replaced by $(pwd).

 4.6  chgrp - Change file group ownership


 4.6.1  Synopsis


 chgrp  [-R] group file ...


 4.6.2  Description

 The chgrp utility shall set the group ID of the file named by each file
 operand to the group ID specified by the group operand.

 For each file operand, it shall perform actions equivalent to the
 POSIX.1 {8} chown() function, called with the following arguments:

     (1)  The file operand shall be used as the path argument.

     (2)  The user ID of the file shall be used as the owner argument.

     (3)  The specified group ID shall be used as the group argument.


 4.6.3  Options

 The chgrp utility shall conform to the utility argument syntax guidelines
 described in 2.10.2.

 The following option shall be supported by the implementation:

    -R          Recursively change file group IDs.  For each file operand
                that names a directory, chgrp shall change the group of
                the directory and all files in the file hierarchy below
                it.


 4.6.4  Operands

 The following operands shall be supported by the implementation:

    group       A group name from the group database or a numeric group
                ID.  Either specifies a group ID to be given to each file
                named by one of the file operands.  If a numeric group
                operand exists in the group database as a group name, the
                group ID number associated with that group name is used as
                the group ID.
